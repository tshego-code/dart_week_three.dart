# ART-WEEK-3: Object-Oriented Programming in Dart üê¶

**Author:** Tshegofatso Moloto  
**Institution:** PLP Academy  
**Week:** 3  

---

## üìå Overview
This Dart program demonstrates **core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts**:

- **Encapsulation**  
- **Inheritance**  
- **Polymorphism**  
- **Abstraction**  

The program uses classes and objects to **illustrate real-world scenarios**, such as bank accounts, students, animals, and geometric shapes.

## üß© Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Encapsulation
- Sensitive data like account balance and account number are **hidden using private variables**.  
- Access is controlled through **getter methods and controlled functions** like `deposit()` and `withdraw()`.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Inheritance
- `Student` class inherits from `Person` class.  
- Demonstrates **code reuse and shared behavior** with added subclass-specific methods.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Polymorphism
- Method overriding is demonstrated with `Animal` subclasses (`Dog` and `Cat`).  
- Shows how **different classes implement the same method differently**.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Abstraction
- `Shape` is an **abstract class** defining methods `area()` and `perimeter()`.  
- `Circle` and `Rectangle` implement these methods, providing **concrete behavior**.
